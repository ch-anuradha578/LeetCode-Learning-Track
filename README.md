## How to Compile and Run the Code

### Prerequisites:
- Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)
- A code editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) or terminal

### Using Command Line:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the Java file.  
   For example, if you're working on **Day 1**, navigate to the `day1` folder:
   ```bash
   cd day1
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
